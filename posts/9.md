## Grooming of Sikh girls by Upper-Caste Hindu Boys

### _Brahmanism is the exact opposite of Sikhi. It would be impossible to nurture Sikhi virtues in a family if the spouse's inclination is towards Brahmanical vices._

The recent incidents of Sikh girls getting married and converted by Muslim boys in Pakistan have rightfully gained a lot of the Sikh community's mind space. Daughter of Sikh Granthi of Nankana Sahib allegedly kidnapped, converted, and married a Muslim man sparked massive outrage on either side of the border. Though the girl said on camera that nobody forced her, and it was her own decision.

It's true, all such incidents cannot be generalized as forced conversion, but at the same time, forced conversions in Pakistan also cannot be dismissed. In one of his speeches, Pakistan PM appeared to be admitting that forced conversions of non-Muslims are the reality of the day. While addressing an event in connection with National Minorities Day, Imran Khan termed the practice of forced conversions as "un-Islamic."

These incidents in Pakistan have given fuel to the forces shattered by the goodwill created after the Kartarpur Corridor opening. The Sikh diaspora advocating peace on both sides of Punjab had to face incisive questions for being "silent" on the matter. However, it would be wrong to call them silent as these incidents have drawn much attention and debate on every platform. Is the "silence" narrative's underlying motive to discourage the Sikhs from developing further bonhomie on the other side of the border?

There has been a detailed report on the grooming of Sikh girls in the UK. According to claims in a report, gangs of predominantly Pakistani men have been grooming British Sikh girls for decades. The study alleges that young Sikh women have been "targeted" by Muslim men subjected to sexual abuse.

#### Deflection has become a norm

Fortunately, the incidents in Pakistan and the UK have become a point of debate within the community. Without losing the focus towards the already acknowledged problem, this write-up aims to draw attention towards an issue that is at least a hundred times grimmer than this. The grooming, conversion, and marriage of Sikh girls by upper-caste Hindu boys. Unfortunately, this could not become the point of discussion among community members.

A Sikh girl marrying a Muslim man is the news, but Sikh girls marrying upper-caste Hindu boys have become too familiar. Deflection becoming a norm is the real problem. Such Brahmanical enslavement becoming Sikh psyche can be understood from Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha as he wrote in the introduction of his book Hum Hindu Nahi (We Are Not Hindus):

Differentiation of Khalsa only from Hinduism is written in this book because our people (Sikhs) already consider themselves different from other religions. Due to ignorance, consider Khalsa as part of Hindus or a subset of Hinduism.

#### It's too a religious conversion

Hasn't the terms like 'grooming,' 'conversion' along with 'upper-caste' Hindus offended or appeared aberration to many readers? If a Sikh girl marrying to Muslim is considered a conversion, why it's not with an upper-caste Hindu? Yes, no such ceremony of religious conversion is held before marrying a Hindu boy, as seen while marrying a Muslim boy. But this flexibility is the way how Brahmansim operates, infiltrate, and assimilate.

In many cases, a Sikh girl's marriage with an upper-caste Hindu boy is solemnized as per Sikh rituals in Gurdwara. In reality, the ceremony turns out to be a farewell to the bride from the Sikh way of life. Followed by this, a Sikh girl enters a new life spiced-up by Karva Chauth, Mundan of newborns, and all those Brahmanical rituals rejected by Gurbani. Sikhi for the offsprings gets reduced to bowing head to the garlanded imaginary picture of Gurus hung on one corner of the wall. Almost every Sikh household would agree with these experiences, because such marriages have happened in nearly everyone's close relation. How come it's not a conversion?

Here it is important to mention that every adult is free to choose his life partner. I do not intend to question the freedom of Sikh girls. A girl has full liberty to decide whom she wants to marry. This write-up is not to curb the freedom of girls who have already decided their fate. I have borrowed courage from the people who question a woman's decision when she marries a Muslim man.

The aim is to start a discussion within every Sikh household much before an adult falls prey to Brahmanism's flexible arms. So it is crucial to mention that this 'love affair' mostly happens with upper-caste Hindu boys.

#### Marriage from the Sikhi perspective

Gurbani guides us that every human being should love the creation and imbibe the godly attributes of fearlessness and without-hate. In fact, that's the sole aim of human life. This realization makes the action of a Sikh directed towards the well-being of all- Sarbat Da Bhalla. Marriage is regarded as a pious institute for two 'like-minded' souls to achieve a common goal. So is named Anand Kaaraj- A Blissful Custom. Every Sikh needs to contemplate the very basics of Sikhi values before deciding to choose a life partner. The purpose would help them to differentiate between love and infatuation. Love-affair needs to be reserved for One Creator and his Creation. All the temporal relations- mother, father, spouse, siblings, children- if becomes satsangat turns out to be a blessing to help achieve the spiritual goal of life.

Our children need to be aware of Brahmanism's fundamentals, based on inequality and hate. Brahmanism is the exact opposite of Sikhi. It would be impossible to nurture Sikhi virtues in a family if the spouse's inclination is towards Brahmanical vices.

At the same time, it would be felicitating if a non-Sikh is drawn towards the fragrance of Gurbani and so decides to tie the nuptial knot irrespective of caste, religion, or nationality.

Let me throw back the question- Why there's graveyard "silence" on the upper-caste Hindu boys marrying Sikh girls, which has gained an epidemic form? Is this slumber a price to stay Indian nationalists?
