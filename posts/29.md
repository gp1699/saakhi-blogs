## Social Media Sikh Warriors Require Detoxification Thru Series Of Gurbani Kirtan & Vichaar

### _If we have started hating others based on their color, religion, nationality, or caste. This is a sign we are missing Gurbani vichaar._

![Social Media Sikh Warriors]( https://app.sikhsaakhi.com/website/blog/resources/images/SocialMedia_SikhWarriors.jpg)

Compassion and Love for humanity is the foundation of Sikh Dharam. Compassion is such an important virtue that Guru Nanak Ji considers Dharam as an offspring of it:   
_ਧੌਲੁ ਧਰਮੁ ਦਇਆ ਕਾ ਪੂਤੁ ॥ ਸੰਤੋਖੁ ਥਾਪਿ ਰਖਿਆ ਜਿਨਿ ਸੂਤਿ ॥ ਜੇ ਕੋ ਬੁਝੈ ਹੋਵੈ ਸਚਿਆਰੁ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 3)_  

Compassion is an indispensable aspect of Dharam. Even the weapon, a Sword, is named ‘Kirpan’ (Kirpa + aan). This is to remind that if a Sikh raise arm, this has to with compassion for justice and equality, not for revenge or hate.

The divine virtues of Nirbhau & Nirvaer makes Sikhi a unique faith. All the Sikh institutes, terminologies, and slogans demonstrates these virues on ground. Institutes like- Gurdwaras, Sangat-Pangat. Our distinct terminologies like- Shabad-Guru, Khalsa, Kirpan, Panj Piyare. Our slogans- Degh Tegh Fateh, Jo Bole So Nihal Sat Sri Akal, Sarbat Da Bhalla. All these rightfully represent Sikhi borne out of divine virtues. 

BUT these days many Sikh youth appear to be active and concerned about Sikh society, but actually are filled with hate towards ‘others.’ Others include almost everyone- Sikhs and non-Sikhs both- whoever does not fit into their myopic version of Sikhi. Social media grooming has contributed to their hot blood and aggression. The algorithm of social media is designed in such a way that it promotes that has greater tendency to be liked, shared, and commented upon. Hate & fake news obviously drives greater viewership.   

Today’s Sikh youth have grown-up in a social media age. They haven’t seen or experienced the pre-social media world. Many of them have learnt Sikhi from the 5 min bytes posted on these platforms. However, a large part of Gurbani is in long series. Like- Jap, So Dar, Sohila, Asa ki Vaar, Sidh Gosht, Anand, Sukhmani, Barah Maha, Patti Likhi, and more. Purposefully it needs to be contemplated in series as Gurmat concepts are discussed in detail with continuation of subject. The individual shabads also require a dedicated approach with equipoise. That’s what used to happen in the pre-social media era. Often a pracharak would stay in a village or Gurdwara for days where he/she would do vichaar on these baanis, verse by verse. This used to take 7 days to 15days or more in one place.   

Ironically a 29-day journey with 13 halts was termed as ‘Khalsa Vaheer’ by WPD lead by Amritpal Singh, and this was propagated as revival of some Old Tradition. It’s hard to say if the Khalsa Vaheer provided platform to contemplate on Gurbani, but it definitely created divisions by referring efforts of ‘others’ as “koorh parchaar.” Amritpal Singh himself is a product of social media grooming possessing fairly swell knowledge of various political issues, but poor hold over Gurmat Concepts. Political correctness didn’t go well with a system that promotes corrupt, rewards dishonesty and suppress rights of minorities. This led to the unjust detention of Amritpal Singh with dramatics. His interviews and speeches were often found to be politically correct but lack discourse on Gurbani. This is OK for a political leader, but he projected himself as a religious leader of Sikhs. And so, lack of the capability to discourse on Gurbani by a Sikh religious leader should not have gone unnoticed. But the social media algorithm that distracts from the patience hearing of Gurbani Vichaar made it go unnoticed. Gurbani Vichaar is supposed to be the daily routine of every Sikh:  
_ਗੁਰ ਕੀ ਬਾਣੀ ਅਨਦਿਨੁ ਗਾਵੈ ਸਹਜੇ ਭਗਤਿ ਕਰਾਵਣਿਆ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 110)_  
_ਡਿਠੈ ਮੁਕਤਿ ਨ ਹੋਵਈ ਜਿਚਰੁ ਸਬਦਿ ਨ ਕਰੇ ਵੀਚਾਰੁ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 594)_  

Hate is always directionless. Hate is never in control of the person who is holding it in his/her heart. It does not stop at one place. Instead of discussing or challenging others’ ideology, hate always tends to target individuals or groups of individuals on the basis of their religion, caste, color, gender, etc.   

When someone has already judged others because of their beliefs, caste, religion or color, the scope for discourse ends there itself. The social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter are not even designed for discourse. These platforms have become fool’s paradise for such hate mongers.     

Islamophobia is a term given to tendency where a person hates others because of their Muslim name. Instead of engaging in inter-faith dialogue where you can present your point of view regarding (or against) Islamic beliefs, Islamophobic persons targets individuals simply because they have a Muslim name.   

Gurbani has shown us the way of inter-faith dialogue. For example, Guru Nanak Ji rejects after-death dogmatic belief which holds key importance in Islam:  
_ਮਿਟੀ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਕੀ ਪੇੜੈ ਪਈ ਕੁਮ੍ਹ੍ਹਿਆਰ ॥ ਘੜਿ ਭਾਂਡੇ ਇਟਾ ਕੀਆ ਜਲਦੀ ਕਰੇ ਪੁਕਾਰ ॥_   
_ਜਲਿ ਜਲਿ ਰੋਵੈ ਬਪੁੜੀ ਝੜਿ ਝੜਿ ਪਵਹਿ ਅੰਗਿਆਰ ॥ ਨਾਨਕ ਜਿਨਿ ਕਰਤੈ ਕਾਰਣੁ ਕੀਆ ਸੋ ਜਾਣੈ ਕਰਤਾਰੁ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 466)_  

But at the same time, Guru never judges others based on their religion or caste. Karta-Purakh signifies that the One Creator permeates in all His creation. In fact, this realization is equivalent to ‘sanka naasi’ (dispelling of illusion):   
_ਅਵਲਿ ਅਲਹ ਨੂਰੁ ਉਪਾਇਆ ਕੁਦਰਤਿ ਕੇ ਸਭ ਬੰਦੇ ॥ ਏਕ ਨੂਰ ਤੇ ਸਭੁ ਜਗੁ ਉਪਜਿਆ ਕਉਨ ਭਲੇ ਕੋ ਮੰਦੇ ॥੧॥_  
_ਲੋਗਾ ਭਰਮਿ ਨ ਭੂਲਹੁ ਭਾਈ ॥ ਖਾਲਿਕੁ ਖਲਕ ਖਲਕ ਮਹਿ ਖਾਲਿਕੁ ਪੂਰਿ ਰਹਿਓ ਸ੍ਰਬ ਠਾਂਈ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥_   
_ਮਾਟੀ ਏਕ ਅਨੇਕ ਭਾਂਤਿ ਕਰਿ ਸਾਜੀ ਸਾਜਨਹਾਰੈ ॥ ਨਾ ਕਛੁ ਪੋਚ ਮਾਟੀ ਕੇ ਭਾਂਡੇ ਨਾ ਕਛੁ ਪੋਚ ਕੁੰਭਾਰੈ ॥੨॥_   
_ਸਭ ਮਹਿ ਸਚਾ ਏਕੋ ਸੋਈ ਤਿਸ ਕਾ ਕੀਆ ਸਭੁ ਕਛੁ ਹੋਈ ॥ ਹੁਕਮੁ ਪਛਾਨੈ ਸੁ ਏਕੋ ਜਾਨੈ ਬੰਦਾ ਕਹੀਐ ਸੋਈ ॥੩॥_  
_ਅਲਹੁ ਅਲਖੁ ਨ ਜਾਈ ਲਖਿਆ ਗੁਰਿ ਗੁੜੁ ਦੀਨਾ ਮੀਠਾ ॥ ਕਹਿ ਕਬੀਰ ਮੇਰੀ ਸੰਕਾ ਨਾਸੀ ਸਰਬ ਨਿਰੰਜਨੁ ਡੀਠਾ ॥੪॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 466)_   

Unfortunately, Islamophobic tendency is found in a small section of Sikhs also. Though we don’t find Islamobhobic among the visible Sikh Influencers, but there are few on social media who are desperately trying to grow their influence. We don’t see their faces on live debates or other video platforms, probably because they are waiting for Islamophobe to become a norm in Sikh society as it is in Hindu society. Hence this needs to be discussed before it becomes a menace.  

Very recently I had an argument on twitter with Amarjeet Singh, New Zealand, who runs podcast by name of The Sikh Renaissance (Twitter @RenaissanceSikh) with punch line ‘Enlivening, Intense And Intelligent Talks On All Things Sikh.’ I invited Amarjeet Singh for zoom meeting to discuss his points and share the video recording for the benefits of others. But he outrightly denied and insisted on interacting on twitter itself. Probably, he is shy of showing his face and understands that he can never justify his point on the touchstone of Gurmat.  

![The Sikh Renaissance](https://app.sikhsaakhi.com/website/blog/resources/images/AmarjeetSingh.jpg)

In one of his quote tweet he writes-   
_“Sikhs should just step aside and allow Israel and Modi to continue with their pest control. Pedophile worshippers are nothing but vermin.”_    

The fascists terminology of “vermin” and “pest” is used for Muslims. He used “pest control” to invoke genocide of Arab Muslims, and “Pedophile” is referred to Prophet Muhammad. This two-line tweet should be sufficient to prove that I’m referring to hard core Islamophobe. We all know that genocide include brutal killings of men, women, pregnant, old, young, children, and infants, and yet he has audacity to invoke ghastly inhuman act. No matter what the provocation is, nothing can justify writing such an appalling message. He writes not under his personal name, but under the name of ‘The Sikh Renaissance,’ thus defaming Sikhi.  

The genocidal threats to Sikhs from Hindutva fascists have become rampant on social media platforms including clubhouse. And there are Islamic & Christian handles who often post foul comments about Sikh History, Sikh identity or Sikh way of life. They need to be exposed effectively, without losing the virtues that a Sikh is always supposed to nurture:  
_ਜੇ ਕੋਈ ਨਿੰਦ ਕਰੇ ਹਰਿ ਜਨ ਕੀ ਅਪੁਨਾ ਗੁਨੁ ਨ ਗਵਾਵੈ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 719)_       

Twitter handles like ‘Tracking Hate Against Sikhs’ (@thaSikhs) are doing very good job in exposing and responding to such anti-Sikh hate mongers.   

Sikhs have suffered genocidal violence at the hands of both Islamic & Hindu Rulers. Despite Sikhs suffered the extreme torture and killings during entire period of eighteenth century, at no point of time any Sikh leader ever thought of committing an act of mindless violence on commoners. Sikhs are known for the compassion even in the times of war. It was for this reason that Muslim majority Lahorites themselves welcomed Ranjit Singh to rule over them. 

Just after the Chhota Ghallughara (smaller massacre) and Vadda Ghallughara (bigger massacre) of eighteenth century, when power came into the hands of Sikhs under the leadership of Maharja Ranjit Singh, Hindus & Muslims along with Sikhs were all regarded equally without any discrimination. Chhota Ghalughara was planned by Diwan Lakhpat Rai (Hindu) of Lahore, while Vadda Ghallughara by Afghan Ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali (Muslim).    

A common Sikh has no doubt that the fight remains with oppressive regimes not with the masses of other religion. So even after Teeja Ghalughara (third massacre) of 1984, we didn’t hear any news of mob violence by Sikhs against Hindu lives or properties in Punjab.   

A strategy that unites all hate mongers is that they love to demonize ‘good’ words. We often hear ‘sickular’ and ‘liberandu’ from Hindutva hate mongers to demean ‘secular’ and ‘liberal’. After successfully grasping this skill Amarjeet Singh has coined new terminology to demean others. ‘Clear-hearted’, ‘brotherhood’ and 'humanity' words are demonized with ‘dil-saafery’, ‘bhaichara klun’ and 'hoomanity.' In the same sequence he distorts name of Ravi Singh (Khalsa Aid) to Ravi Khan.  

Though there are few famed Sikh International Charity Organizations like Unites Sikhs, and Nishkam Swat, founded on the principle of Universal brotherhood & selfless service, but it is the Khalsa Aid that faces the wrath of these hate mongers. Probably because Khalsa Aid has a face, Ravi Singh, while others don’t have. Amritpal Singh (WPD) in his earlier videos also used to demean Khalsa Aid by referring ‘laangri.’ Amarjeet Singh has gone a step further by replacing ‘Singh’ with ‘Khan’ in his name.  

The pretension of hate mongers is that Sikhs should use their resources on Sikhs first. Amarjeet Singh while comparing the efforts of Gurmat Parchar Sewa Madhya Pradesh helping Sikligar Sikhs with that of Khalsa Aid writes-   
_“This veer is actively serving the Sikligars and other marginalized Sikh communities throughout Madhya Pradesh. Rather than donate to fraudsters like Ravi Khan who splurges our resources and those communities who pray for our extipation 5 times a day, donate to a fellow Sikh.”_   
Note: He refers “5 times a day” to Muslim prayer (namaaz).  

There’s no denying that a lot needs to be done for the various marginalized sections of Sikhs both within Punjab & outside Punjab. There are many organizations involved in these efforts and they must be supported with all means. All efforts should be and can be accomplished simultaneously. At the same time, international charity organizations receive funds not only from Sikhs but from other communities’ also. For Covid-19 relief work in India, Khalsa Aid received ‘six-figure’ donation amount from JK Rowling’s charitable trust. In Sept 2019, World Financial Group (associates) donated $185,000 CDN, the single largest donation that was to be used for Panjab Floods Relief seva.   

Even if the “splurges our resources” logic is to be considered for the sake of debate, the hate mongers should have supported their allegations with the financials of Khalsa Aid. What if, out of total donation, Khalsa Aid receives less (say 55%) from Sikhs, but actual money spent on Sikhs is more (say 60%). However, hate mongers must understand that every effort has its own role and importance. There’s no need to pull someone down to push others.   

International Sikh Charity organizations have a very important role not only in spreading the message of universal brotherhood as enshrined in Gurbani, but also to enhance soft power of Sikhs. Post Covid-19 and Kisaan Andolan many non-Sikhs (dalits, jaats) have embraced Sikhi. Many of these new followers have said on record that langars provided by Sikh organizations and Gurdwaras without any discrimination have inspired them.       

There is another argument used by Islamophobes, which appears to be their favorite question. Amarjeet Singh summarizes as-   
_“These same liberals (for want of a batter term) argue that each and every Hindu is evil for believing in caste. That Hinduism is morally corrupt. That the norm outweighs the exception. But why the double standards when it’s a Muslim? What do they hope to get out of this myopia?”_   

Find below some of the arguments in response to his tweet:  
1)	“Believing in caste” is a meaningless term. He has intentionally downplayed the Brahmanical vice by replacing ‘discrimination’ or ‘inequality’ with “believing.” That’s hypocrisy and dishonesty. Gurbani recognizes diversity and mentions several sub-castes, like- chamar, chimba, jatt, sodhi, julaha etc. But Gurbani categorically rejects varna ashram which is ‘graded inequality.’ So, anyone who is discriminating with others on the basis of caste must be called out.  
2)	No wise Sikh will say “every Hindu is evil.” If someone has said so, it’s a hate. Not only Hindus, but Brahmins too deserve to be freed from Brahmanism.   
3)	“That Hinduism is morally corrupt.” Again, a meaningless term. But I agree- Brahmanism is morally corrupt.  
4)	“Norm outweighs the exception.” Firstly, he downplayed Brahmanism to compare with Islam. Secondly, there appears a gap of fundamental understanding between Brahmanism with that of Islam. This needs to be answered in two parts:  

A)	The fact is just the opposite. Rather, exceptional encounters with Islamic fundamentalists are treated with more seriousness. On the other hand, similar acts have become a norm vis-à-vis Brahmanists. For ex. Sikh community protests and make massive noise when it comes of Sikh girl eloping with a Muslim man in Pakistan or Kashmir. In the recent cases, the Pakistan Govt had to intervene to pacify Sikhs. There’s no denying there have also been appalling incidents of forcible abduction in Pakistan. Sexual grooming gangs of predominantly Pakistani Muslims were identified in UK that have raped many girls, out of which many were Sikh girls. Despite of taboo around discussing such issues, UK Sikhs raised awareness around this, and the gangs were exposed with names by UK authorities. We know the details because it was addressed suitably, and a number of reports published on this. On the hand, Sikh Girls marrying Hindu Upper Caste boys has become a norm. No noise and no efforts to rectify, rather marriages are solemnized with fanfare and Bhangra. The grooming of Sikh girls in India has become a cultural norm and a symbol of Hindu-Sikh brotherhood.  
B)	Sikhs have suffered genocidal violence at the hands of Islamic, Brahmanical, and British (Christian) regimes. They are part of everyday Sikh History & discourses, and we should always be vigilant of dangers in future. Sikhs still live under constant threat of genocidal violence at the hands of Hindutavis. But it is only from Brahmanism, Sikhs face ideological intrusion. Islam has little capability to intrude into Sikh way of life. Whatever, deviations we see today in Sikh way of life are Brahmanical intrusions. Like- karva Chauth, masya, pooranmashi, chaliye katna, pilgrimages, fake brahmanical stories of Gurus, etc. The closest Islamic intrusion in Sikhi is grave (marhi) worshiping. But grave worshipping in itself is deviation from Islam towards Brahmanism. So, Brahmanism remains the core threat to the Sikh values. Any downplaying of it not only reflects hypocrisy but dishonesty towards Sikhi.  
 
I have touched upon only a few tweets and there’s still more to write on these; my write-up has gone 2500+ words essay. No wonder, twitter, a platform with word limitation, has become a favorite for hate mongers. They can conveniently post agenda driven couple of hateful lines with several errors and let the other person fall short of words to counter it.  
There is an introspecting question that we must ask ourselves- Have we started hating others based on his/her color, religion, nationality, or caste? If the answer is YES. This is a sign we are missing Gurbani vichaar. To overcome hate we must nurture love and compassion within us, requires detoxification through series of Gurbani Kirtan and Vichaar each and every day.    
_ਹਰਿ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਬਾਣੀ ਮਨੁ ਮਾਰਿਆ ਅਣੀਆਲੇ ਅਣੀਆ ਰਾਮ ਰਾਜੇ ॥ ਜਿਸੁ ਲਾਗੀ ਪੀਰ ਪਿਰੰਮ ਕੀ ਸੋ ਜਾਣੈ ਜਰੀਆ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ 448)_  
_ਸਚੁ ਤਾ ਪਰੁ ਜਾਣੀਐ ਜਾ ਸਿਖ ਸਚੀ ਲੇਇ ॥ ਦਇਆ ਜਾਣੈ ਜੀਅ ਕੀ ਕਿਛੁ ਪੁੰਨੁ ਦਾਨੁ ਕਰੇਇ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 468)_
