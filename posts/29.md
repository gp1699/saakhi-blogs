## Social Media Sikh Warriors Require Detoxification Thru Series Of Gurbani Kirtan & Vichaar

### _If we have started hating others based on their color, religion, nationality, or caste. This is a sign we are missing Gurbani vichaar._

The generational gap has always been there. It's not new. Here's a famous quote from the 1930s:   
_"Every generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it." (George Orwell)_  

For the children who are disrespectful to their parents under the influence of materialism, Guru Sahib says:  
_ਕਾਹੇ ਪੂਤ ਝਗਰਤ ਹਉ ਸੰਗਿ ਬਾਪ ॥ ਜਿਨ ਕੇ ਜਣੇ ਬਡੀਰੇ ਤੁਮ ਹਉ ਤਿਨ ਸਿਉ ਝਗਰਤ ਪਾਪ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 1200)_  

It is true many of our current institutes and Gurdwaras are not able to answer the questions of the new generation. Only a few management committees have the capability and resources to include interactive methodology to attract youth.  

But I need to concentrate on another important aspect that is unique to current times. This simply should not be dismissed as a generational gap but is more due to digital & social media disruption. The endless scroll of images, likes, and comments put our brains in a constant state of excitement hindering our ability to focus on patient hearing. It gives a hit of dopamine to our brains and is addictive. It is making us uninterested in our core institute - Sangat Pangat, requiring sahaj (equipoise). Another worst effect of new-age technology is that it drives hate.  

People worldwide are discussing the consequences that social media and Artificial Intelligence are causing and will create on various aspects of human life. However, Sikhs haven't yet initiated the discussion on its impact on the Sikh Institutes. We don't have the answers to imbibe the upcoming technology while staying intact to the Sikh ethos. We need to start this discussion.  

Compassion and Love for humanity is the foundation of Sikh Dharam.  Compassion is such an important virtue that Guru Nanak Ji considers Dharam as an offspring of it:   
_ਧੌਲੁ ਧਰਮੁ ਦਇਆ ਕਾ ਪੂਤੁ ॥ ਸੰਤੋਖੁ ਥਾਪਿ ਰਖਿਆ ਜਿਨਿ ਸੂਤਿ ॥ ਜੇ ਕੋ ਬੁਝੈ ਹੋਵੈ ਸਚਿਆਰੁ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 3)_  

Compassion is an indispensable aspect of Dharam. Even the weapon, a Sword, is named 'Kirpan' (Kirpa + aan). This is to remind us that if a Sikh raise arms, this has to do with compassion for justice and equality, not for revenge or hate.  

The divine virtues of Nirbhau & Nirvaer make Sikhi a unique faith. All the Sikh institutes, terminologies, and slogans demonstrate these virtues on the ground. Institutes like- Gurdwaras, Sangat-Pangat. Our distinct terminologies like- Shabad-Guru, Khalsa, Kirpan, Panj Piyare. Our slogans- Degh Tegh Fateh, Jo Bole So Nihal Sat Sri Akal, Sarbat Da Bhalla. All these rightfully represent Sikhi borne out of divine virtues.  

BUT these days many Sikhs especially youth appear to be active and concerned about Sikh society but are filled with hate towards 'others.' Others include almost everyone- Sikhs and non-Sikhs both- whoever does not fit into their myopic version of Sikhi. Social media grooming has contributed to their hot blood and aggression. The algorithm of social media is designed in such a way that it promotes that has a greater tendency to be liked, shared, and commented upon. Hate & fake news drives greater viewership.  

Today's Sikh youth is unfortunate in the sense that they haven't seen or experienced the pre-social media world. Many of them have learned Sikhi from the 5 min bytes posted on these platforms. However, a large part of Gurbani is in long series. Like- Jap, So Dar, Sohila, Asa ki Vaar, Sidh Gosht, Anand, Sukhmani, Barah Maha, Patti Likhi, and more. Purposefully it needs to be contemplated in series as Gurmat concepts are discussed in detail with the continuation of the subject. The individual shabads also require a dedicated approach with equipoise. That's what used to happen in the pre-social media era. Often a pracharak would stay in a village or Gurdwara for days where he/she would do vichaar on these baanis, verse by verse. This used to take 7 days to 15 days or more in one place. This cannot be substituted by a 'Khalsa Vaheer' of a 29-day journey with 13 halts. Gurbani Vichaar is supposed to be the daily routine of every Sikh:  
_ਗੁਰ ਕੀ ਬਾਣੀ ਅਨਦਿਨੁ ਗਾਵੈ ਸਹਜੇ ਭਗਤਿ ਕਰਾਵਣਿਆ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 110)_  
_ਡਿਠੈ ਮੁਕਤਿ ਨ ਹੋਵਈ ਜਿਚਰੁ ਸਬਦਿ ਨ ਕਰੇ ਵੀਚਾਰੁ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 594)_  

There have always been several differences within various sections of Sikhs. Differences of rehat maryada, raag maala, dasam granth, etc have been for many years now. But still, around 15 to 20 years ago, two personalities with different viewpoints were seen sitting together or doing katha on the same stage. Now, it's gone and each one of them is trying to prove the other as a lesser Sikh, abusing each other on social media platforms. The scope of samvaad (discourse) ends with such language. The social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter are not even designed for discourse. These platforms have become a fool's paradise for such hate-mongers.  

Instead of discussing or challenging others' ideology, hate always tends to target individuals or groups of individuals based on their religion, caste, color, gender, belief, etc.  

Gurbani has shown us the way of inter-faith dialogue. For example, Guru Nanak Ji rejects after-death dogmatic belief which holds key importance in Islam:  
_ਮਿਟੀ ਮੁਸਲਮਾਨ ਕੀ ਪੇੜੈ ਪਈ ਕੁਮ੍ਹ੍ਹਿਆਰ ॥ ਘੜਿ ਭਾਂਡੇ ਇਟਾ ਕੀਆ ਜਲਦੀ ਕਰੇ ਪੁਕਾਰ ॥_   
_ਜਲਿ ਜਲਿ ਰੋਵੈ ਬਪੁੜੀ ਝੜਿ ਝੜਿ ਪਵਹਿ ਅੰਗਿਆਰ ॥ ਨਾਨਕ ਜਿਨਿ ਕਰਤੈ ਕਾਰਣੁ ਕੀਆ ਸੋ ਜਾਣੈ ਕਰਤਾਰੁ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 466)_  

But at the same time, Guru never judges others based on their religion or caste. Karta-Purakh signifies that the One Creator permeates in all His creation. In fact, this realization is equivalent to 'sanka naasi' (dispelling of illusion):   
_ਅਵਲਿ ਅਲਹ ਨੂਰੁ ਉਪਾਇਆ ਕੁਦਰਤਿ ਕੇ ਸਭ ਬੰਦੇ ॥ ਏਕ ਨੂਰ ਤੇ ਸਭੁ ਜਗੁ ਉਪਜਿਆ ਕਉਨ ਭਲੇ ਕੋ ਮੰਦੇ ॥੧॥_  
_ਲੋਗਾ ਭਰਮਿ ਨ ਭੂਲਹੁ ਭਾਈ ॥ ਖਾਲਿਕੁ ਖਲਕ ਖਲਕ ਮਹਿ ਖਾਲਿਕੁ ਪੂਰਿ ਰਹਿਓ ਸ੍ਰਬ ਠਾਂਈ ॥੧॥ ਰਹਾਉ ॥_   
_ਮਾਟੀ ਏਕ ਅਨੇਕ ਭਾਂਤਿ ਕਰਿ ਸਾਜੀ ਸਾਜਨਹਾਰੈ ॥ ਨਾ ਕਛੁ ਪੋਚ ਮਾਟੀ ਕੇ ਭਾਂਡੇ ਨਾ ਕਛੁ ਪੋਚ ਕੁੰਭਾਰੈ ॥੨॥_   
_ਸਭ ਮਹਿ ਸਚਾ ਏਕੋ ਸੋਈ ਤਿਸ ਕਾ ਕੀਆ ਸਭੁ ਕਛੁ ਹੋਈ ॥ ਹੁਕਮੁ ਪਛਾਨੈ ਸੁ ਏਕੋ ਜਾਨੈ ਬੰਦਾ ਕਹੀਐ ਸੋਈ ॥੩॥_  
_ਅਲਹੁ ਅਲਖੁ ਨ ਜਾਈ ਲਖਿਆ ਗੁਰਿ ਗੁੜੁ ਦੀਨਾ ਮੀਠਾ ॥ ਕਹਿ ਕਬੀਰ ਮੇਰੀ ਸੰਕਾ ਨਾਸੀ ਸਰਬ ਨਿਰੰਜਨੁ ਡੀਠਾ ॥੪॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 466)_   

Without mincing any words Gurbani exposes the hypocrisy of priesthood and raises awareness against the karamkaands (fake rituals) of Brahmanical and Islamic traditions. But lone awareness is prone to shift toward hate. So, 'prema-bhaav' (love & compassion) for a reason remains the overflowing aspect of Gurbani. The harm social media is causing in our societies is that it gives the user the presumption of being aware, of being up-to-date, but the dearth of compassion leads to arrogance and aggression.  

A strategy that unites all hate mongers is that they love to demonize 'good' words. We often hear 'sickular' and 'liberandu' from Hindutva hate mongers to demean 'secular' and 'liberal'. On similar lines, some Sikh handlers have coined new terminology to demean other Sikhs who do not conform to their viewpoint.  'Clear-hearted,' 'brotherhood,' 'elderly Sikhs,' and 'humanity' words are demonized with 'dil-saafery,' 'bhaichara klun,' 'boomers,' and 'hoomanity' respectively. In the same sequence 'Singh' is replaced with 'Khan' or 'Chand,' or 'Singh' is altogether not written with others' names. This is to insist that their version of Sikhi is the ultimate truth, and whoever does not conform to it is not 'Singh.'  

We know that the genocidal threats to Sikhs from Hindutva fascists have become rampant on social media platforms including the clubhouse. And there are Islamic & Christian handles that often post foul comments about Sikh History & Gurus, Sikh identity, or Sikh way of life.  

How should Sikhs counter this on social media? Some of the effective ways:  
1. They need to be exposed effectively. Twitter handles like 'Tracking Hate Against Sikhs' (@thaSikhs) are doing a very good job in exposing and responding to such anti-Sikh hate mongers. Such examples need to be replicated and extended.  
2. Report the hateful content so that such handles are blocked by the service provider. Or proceed with legal action (if possible).  
3. Many of the hateful handles have agenda to create divisions within society. It's better to unfollow or ignore and not give them the attention that they are seeking from you.    

The worst thing to do is to fall into the trap of the social media algorithm of hate.  

Whatever methodology we adopt to respond, that should be without losing the virtues that a Sikh is always supposed to nurture:  
_ਜੇ ਕੋਈ ਨਿੰਦ ਕਰੇ ਹਰਿ ਜਨ ਕੀ ਅਪੁਨਾ ਗੁਨੁ ਨ ਗਵਾਵੈ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 719)_  

Unfortunately, Islamophobic tendency is found in a small section of Sikhs also. Instead of using personal names and pictures, they use generic "Sikh" nomenclature or Sikh symbols in their profiles. Hence defaming Sikhi.  

Sikhs have suffered genocidal violence at the hands of both Islamic & Hindu Rulers. But at no point of time during the eighteenth century, any Sikh leader ever thought of committing an act of mindless violence on commoners. Sikhs are known for their compassion even in times of war. It was for this reason that Muslim majority Lahorites themselves welcomed Ranjit Singh to rule over them.  

After the Chhota Ghallughara (smaller massacre) and Vadda Ghallughara (bigger massacre) of the eighteenth century, when the power came into the hands of Sikhs under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Hindus & Muslims along with Sikhs were all regarded equally without any discrimination. Chhota Ghalughara was planned by Diwan Lakhpat Rai (Hindu) of Lahore, while Vadda Ghallughara was by Afghan Ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali (Muslim).  

A common Sikh does not doubt that the fight remains with oppressive regimes, not with the masses of other religions.  So even after Teeja Ghalughara (the third massacre) of 1984, we didn't hear any news of mob violence by Sikhs against Hindu lives or properties in Punjab.  

There are only a few famed Sikh International Charity Organizations like Unites Sikhs, and Nishkam Swat, founded on the principle of Universal brotherhood & selfless service, but it is Khalsa Aid that faces the wrath of these hate mongers. Probably because Khalsa Aid has a face, Ravi Singh, while others don't. Some call him "laangri" and others as "Ravi Khan."  

The justification of hate mongers is that Sikhs should use their resources on Sikhs first. There's no denying that a lot needs to be done for the various marginalized sections of Sikhs both within Punjab & outside Punjab. There are many organizations involved in these efforts and they must be supported with all means. All efforts should be and can be accomplished simultaneously.  

At the same time, international charity organizations receive funds not only from Sikhs but from other communities also. For Covid-19 relief work in India, Khalsa Aid received a 'six-figure' donation amount from JK Rowling's charitable trust. In Sept 2019, World Financial Group (associates) donated $185,000 CDN, the single largest donation that was to be used for Panjab Floods Relief seva.  

For the sake of debate, the hate mongers should support their allegations with the financials of Khalsa Aid. What if, out of total donation, Khalsa Aid receives less (say 55%) from Sikhs, but actual money spent on Sikhs is more (say 60%). However, hate mongers must understand that every effort has its role and importance. There's no need to pull someone down to push others.  

International Sikh Charity organizations have a very important role not only in spreading the message of universal brotherhood as enshrined in Gurbani but also to enhance the soft power of Sikhs. Post Covid-19 and Kisaan Andolan many non-Sikhs (dalits, jaats) have embraced Sikhi. Many of these new followers have said on record that langars provided by Sikh organizations and Gurdwaras without any discrimination have inspired them. The 41-year-old Amar Singh's contribution to supporting the community during drought, floods, the COVID-19 pandemic, and bushfires was recognized while bestowing him the 2023 Australian of the Year honor.  

Twitter, a platform with word limitation, has become a favorite for hate-mongers. They can conveniently post an agenda-driven couple of hateful lines with several errors and let the other person fall short of words to counter it.  

There is an introspecting question that we must ask ourselves- Have we started hating others based on his/her color, belief, religion, nationality, or caste? If the answer is YES. This is a sign we have been missing Gurbani vichaar for too long. To overcome hate we must nurture love and compassion within us. This requires detoxification through a series of Gurbani Kirtan and Vichaar every day.  
_ਹਰਿ ਪ੍ਰੇਮ ਬਾਣੀ ਮਨੁ ਮਾਰਿਆ ਅਣੀਆਲੇ ਅਣੀਆ ਰਾਮ ਰਾਜੇ ॥ ਜਿਸੁ ਲਾਗੀ ਪੀਰ ਪਿਰੰਮ ਕੀ ਸੋ ਜਾਣੈ ਜਰੀਆ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ 448)_  
_ਸਚੁ ਤਾ ਪਰੁ ਜਾਣੀਐ ਜਾ ਸਿਖ ਸਚੀ ਲੇਇ ॥ ਦਇਆ ਜਾਣੈ ਜੀਅ ਕੀ ਕਿਛੁ ਪੁੰਨੁ ਦਾਨੁ ਕਰੇਇ ॥ (SGGS ਪੰ: 468)_  

In the meantime, Sikhs must start brainstorming on the disruption that restless social media and AI has posed on the existence of Sikh Institues requiring calmness amd patiences to sustain.

The previous post that was uploaded on 15th June had specific names of individuals with images. Readers have taken it as personal attack though not even a single word was misquoted. I personally feel that if a post is seen personally then it defeats the larger goal. The post is uploaded again by removing all the names and more focused on the serious issue. Thus all the comments of the earlier post have also been removed.
